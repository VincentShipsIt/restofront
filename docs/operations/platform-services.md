# Platform services runbook

Restofront needs PostgreSQL, Redis, and Amazon S3 before production can accept
public imports. Production runs on the shared `api.shipshit.dev` EC2 host in an
isolated container, while data services and credentials remain isolated.

## Environment isolation

Never copy production database or AWS credentials into pull-request builds.
CI uses non-connecting placeholders; runtime credentials are loaded from
encrypted SSM parameters on the EC2 host.

| Service | Production isolation | Runtime variables |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PostgreSQL | Dedicated database and login on the existing private RDS instance | `DATABASE_URL` |
| Workflow | PostgreSQL World with a Restofront job prefix and bounded concurrency | `WORKFLOW_*` |
| Redis | Dedicated container and persistent Docker volume, not published to the host | `REDIS_URL` |
| Images | Private versioned S3 bucket served through CloudFront OAC | `AWS_REGION`, `S3_BUCKET`, `S3_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` |

After configuring production, redeploy it and request `/api/health/ready`. The
route returns `200` only when all three runtime services are reachable.
It returns `503` with variable names and remediation guidance when configuration
is missing or a provider cannot be reached. It never returns connection URLs,
tokens, or provider error bodies.

## Database release procedure

Committed migrations in `prisma/migrations` are the only production schema
source. Do not use `prisma db push` or `prisma migrate dev` against Preview or
Production.

1. Confirm the target shell or CI environment contains the reviewed target
   `DATABASE_URL`.
2. Take or verify a provider backup before any destructive migration.
3. Check migration state with `bun run db:migrate:status`.
4. Apply pending migrations with `bun run db:migrate:deploy`.
5. Redeploy the application and confirm `/api/health/ready` returns `200`.
6. Record the migration name, target environment, operator, and backup reference
   in the release record.

The container applies committed Prisma migrations and the idempotent Workflow
bootstrap before it starts accepting traffic. A candidate must pass its
container health check before Caddy is reloaded. A failed migration stops the
candidate and leaves the current production container running.

## Backup and restore

- RDS keeps seven days of automated backups with deletion protection enabled.
- Keep Preview restore drills separate from Production. Perform a quarterly
  restore into a new, isolated database and verify the migration table and a
  sample restaurant record before deleting the drill database.
- Restore by creating a new database from the selected recovery point, applying
  any later reviewed migrations, validating it, then replacing `DATABASE_URL`
  through a reviewed environment change. Do not overwrite the existing database
  in place.
- S3 versioning protects image originals and derivatives from accidental
  replacement. Retain authentic source URLs and provenance in PostgreSQL.

## Credential ownership and rotation

The repository owner is accountable for provider access, backup policy, and
release approval. A migration operator may execute the reviewed commands but
must not copy credentials into issues, pull requests, logs, or local production
environment files.

Rotate database and external-provider credentials every 90 days and immediately after
suspected exposure or an operator access change:

1. Create the replacement credential.
2. Update the matching SecureString under
   `/shipshit/production/restofront/`.
3. Deploy the exact reviewed image and verify readiness.
4. Revoke the old credential only after production is healthy.
5. Record the date, owner, affected environment, and verification result without
   recording the credential value.

## Deployment

GitHub Actions builds the Docker image without production secrets, uploads the
immutable image archive to the private deployment bucket, and assumes the
repository-scoped AWS OIDC role. The role may upload only Restofront artifacts
and send only `AWS-RunShellScript` commands to the production instance.

The host deployment script:

1. Loads Restofront parameters from SSM without printing them.
2. Starts or verifies the isolated Redis container.
3. Loads the exact image artifact and starts a candidate.
4. Waits for `/api/health/ready`.
5. Swaps container names, reloads Caddy, and rolls back on failure.

Route53 sends `restofront.com`, `www.restofront.com`, and
`domains.restofront.com` to the EC2 Elastic IP. Caddy owns TLS termination.
Customer domains use on-demand TLS, gated by
`/api/domains/authorize`; unverified hostnames cannot cause certificate
issuance.
